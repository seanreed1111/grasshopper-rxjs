RxJS version of the Grasshopper

HOW DO I PLAY THIS GAME?
Grasshopper is a puzzle game where you start off with
1)four grasshoppers on the left side (the "L"-type grasshoppers), and
2)four grasshoppers on the right side (the "R"-type grasshoppers), and
3)one blank space in the middle.

The goal of the puzzle is to switch the "L" and "R" type grasshoppers.
So, to win, you just need to put all the "L"-types to the right side of the board 
and the "R"-types to the left side of the board.

HOW DO THE GRASSHOPPERS MOVE?
After you've clicked on  the Start Button, 
when you CLICK on a grasshopper with your mouse it will move if it can!

Each grasshopper can only move one of two ways
A) Jump over one adjacent grasshopper (of any type) into the blank space, or,
B) move one space into the blank space.

After you play it, try to make the game yourself for practice! 
Maybe add in a timer, or a counter that keeps track of the number of moves you've made to spice it up a bit.
